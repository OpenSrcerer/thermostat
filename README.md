# About
Thermostat is a bot created for Discord servers. Its' main purpose is to aid server owners and administration by adjusting channel slowmode automatically. Staff teams should be focused on interacting with the community instead of constantly monitoring the chat's speed. By getting Thermostat in your server, you get rid of all of the stress that managing slowmode might bring.

# Motivation
This bot was created with larger servers in mind, in order to keep the chat's speed readable and under control, while also defending against large raids & spam attacks. However, even smaller servers will find Thermostat useful.   
Our primary concern is performance and usability, and as such you can expect Thermostat to not let you down.

# Features & How To Use
What makes Thermostat special is the fact that it controls Discord slowmode in a dynamic way, calculating the needed slowmode for a channel dependent on the number of incoming messages in a unit of time. It comes with easy set up, which is only a few commands. You set it, and forget it. Thermostat does not require continuous changes or maintenance.   <a href="https://github.com/OpenSrcerer/thermostat/wiki">Click me to get started!</a>

The Charting feature of Thermostat is one of the most unique among Discord bots. Based on the data that is collected by slowmoding your channels, you are able to visualize the information in highly stylish charts.
